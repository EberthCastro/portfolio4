This Project is made on React Js. THe steps to start on React are following:
First to Open Visual Studio Code, then open New Terminal and write: "npx create-react-app my-carpet" ("my carpet" is where I want to download REact Js)
after the installation you will visualize in the screen terminal two commands: "cd my-carpet" (this is to change directory into my-carpet) and
"npm start" (this is to initialize React on your browser). After that you can start to coding wherever you want. 
I started creating 4 carpets inside the carpet SRC, the first of them was the carpet intro and inside of it the files intro.jsx and intro.css. This method is a good practice, to code by components and divided by carpets. the second carpet was about an its files about.jsx and abput.css and so on with the other carpets.

For this project I used two libraries:
- "npm i react-icons"  wich import the icons for navbar in the size for mobile.
- "npm i emailjs@.com" wich allow send the information from the form to emial associated previously vinculated when you sign in: emailjs.com
